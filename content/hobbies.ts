    description: `Strategy games: My favorite strategy games are mostly Supercell games. This includes Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, and Brawl Stars.
                  I have pushed to the top 1% in all of these games despite being relatively f2p.
                  
                  Gacha games: I am currently enjoying Genshin Impact and Umamusume. I enjoy collecting and building characters and making them
                  as strong as possible to tackle end game or pvp content.
                  
                  Story games: I enjoy games with great stories such as the Uncharted Series, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Cyberpunk 2077. These games
                  have immersive worlds and engaging narratives that keep me hooked.`
